# Bernies-Busy-Bees
This is a web application for Bernie's Busy Bees and is being hosted at https://berniesbusybees.co.uk/ if you'd like to see a live version of this application.

## What is it?
It's basically a blog system coded from the ground up using Golang, JWT authentication, JQuery, Materialize CSS and Amazon's Golang SDK. I've used SES and S3 from Amazon as I love their services (reliable and cheap). The design isn't great as I don't really do design but I'm planning to learn in the future.

## Usage
This code is public as I feel it could help other developers understand some of the features in my application. However, it would be copyright infringement to just reskin this application and call it your own. Please don't host this application or base your own application around it, just use it as a resource to help you code.
